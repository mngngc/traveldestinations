# traveldestinations
This is a project in my WebDev at Kennesaw State University.
I use HTML for initial content and CSS for designing purposes. The website is responsive to different display size (tablet, desktop) and also reactive with components like hamburger menu, text reveal box,... 
The content is my personal experience traveling to Thailand
